# Code Breaker Game

A simple Python game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated 3-digit code. Feedback is provided after each guess to help the player "crack the code."

## How It Works

1. The program generates a random 3-digit code.
2. The player enters their guess.
3. The game provides clues:
   - **Match**: A digit is correct and in the right position.
   - **Close**: A digit is correct but in the wrong position.
   - **Nope**: A digit is not in the code.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct code and receives the message "CODE CRACKED."
